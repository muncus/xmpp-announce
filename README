xmpp-announce - Appengine app for subscription announcements.
====

Purpose:

Channel-based subscription to xmpp messages. Users can create topic-based channels, to which other users may subscribe.
When a notification is triggered (currently by hitting a URL), all subscribed users receive a message via xmpp.

The inspiration for this app was coordinating a coffee break, with several people throughout the office.
